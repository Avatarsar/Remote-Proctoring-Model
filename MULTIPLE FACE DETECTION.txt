MULTIPLE FACE DETECTION 

ABOUT THE MODEL

The code provides a simple real-time face detection system using a webcam feed and alerts when it detects multiple faces and prints "suspicious activity Detected".

DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL

->The Model is imported from MediaPipe and then I finetuned the pre-trained model.The model is used for tasks such as face detection, hand tracking, pose estimation, and more.

->The dataset I found in HuggingFace was not accurated,So I took the dataset from github and modified it
