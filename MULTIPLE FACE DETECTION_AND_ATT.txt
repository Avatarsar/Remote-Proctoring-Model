MULTIPLE FACE DETECTION AND AUDIO TO TEXT CONVERSION

Integrating multiple face detection with audio-to-text conversion for real-time conversation monitoring and recording. Upon detecting multiple faces in a video feed, this project captures and transcribes the audio content into text, facilitating applications like surveillance and documentation. Additionally, the system creates a 'test.txt' file in the Jupiter notebook directory to log these instances.
